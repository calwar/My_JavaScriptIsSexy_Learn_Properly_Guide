/* 2.The following code uses the prompt() function to get two numbers from the user. It
then adds those two numbers and writes the result to the page. However, if you try out the code, you’ll discover that it doesn’t work.
Why not? Change the code so that it does work.*/

/* You need to add the parseInt function to make the code work so the numbers can make the sum when you add them together. 
   The original code did not have the parseInt function.*/
